				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>We love science. That's why. And now we're calling out to all middle schoolers in order to share our love for science. Join us for a morning of fun, and compete with your peers from other middle schools in various events.</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>Teams of up to 7 will participate in three events: multiple choice academic test, a research paper contest, and finally, a hands-on building challenge! All of these events will test not only your knowledge of science and engineering concepts, but also how well you can put them into practice.</p>
				<p>The multiple choice round will consist of two back-to-back tests: you choose which tests to take! Like in the University of Illinois' WYSE contest, the seven subjects you can compete in are: biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, english, math, and physics. Top scoring teams and individuals will be recognized at the awards ceremony.</p>
