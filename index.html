				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				<p>A science competition for students from the District 125 feeder schools hosted by the Stevenson Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE) Club.</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>Each team (up to 8 students) will compete in a multiple choice academic test, an “investigative task” research paper contest, and a hands-on building challenge. Each event will test both academic knowledge and the ability to apply new skills and think critically. Awards will be given for team performance in all events, and overall performance across events.</p>
				<p>The multiple choice round will consist of two back-to-back tests, just like in the high school WYSE competition. Students will choose from seven subjects: biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, english, math, and physics. Top scoring individuals will be recognized.</p>
